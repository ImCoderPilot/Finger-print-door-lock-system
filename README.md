# Finger-print-door-lock-system
This project focuses on creating a secure and convenient door lock system by integrating a smartphone's fingerprint sensor with Arduino and Bluetooth technology. 
As technology continues to evolve rapidly, security systems have become a critical component of present-day life. Conventional locking mechanisms, based on physical keys or combination locks, fail to meet the requirements for adequate security anymore. Fingerprint recognition, a form of biometric authentication, has become a Trustworthy and secure access management solution. By combining Bluetooth with smartphone fingerprint sensors, new opportunities have emerged for creating safe and user-friendly door lock systems. This project focuses on designing and developing a Bluetooth-enabled fingerprint door lock
system, utilizing Arduino and the fingerprint sensor of a smartphone. Biometric authentication, which relies on unique physical or behavioural traits like fingerprints, facial recognition, or voice recognition, is used to authenticate an individualâ€™s identity. Among these, fingerprint recognition stands out as one of the most commonly adopted biometric methods due to its high precision and ease of use. Smartphones have become an integral part of current life, and most modern smartphones come outfitted with fingerprint sensors. These sensors can be employed to enable secure authentication across various applications, such as door lock systems.
